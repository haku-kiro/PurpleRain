# PurpleRain
Clone of Purple rain, done in Monogame


I created a clone of the legendary, [Daniel Shiffmans](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) coding challenge number 4, [purple rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=10s).

I created it using monogame, using a particle engine for the rain. I have plans to improve on the design, do something new.
